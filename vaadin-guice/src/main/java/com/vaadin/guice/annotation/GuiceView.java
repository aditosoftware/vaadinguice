 * the spring vaadin integration, this cannot be overwritten with other scope-annotations like
 * {@link UIScope}.</b>This is an example of a view that is mapped to an
 * empty view name and is available for all UI subclasses in the application:

 * <pre>
 * &#064;GuiceView(name = &quot;&quot;)
 * public class MyDefaultView extends CustomComponent implements View {

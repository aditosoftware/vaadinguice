Vaadin guice
======================

Vaadin guice is the official guice integration for Vaadin Framework version 7.

Building the project
----
Execute `mvn clean install` in the root directory to build guice-vaadin.

Porting from vaadin-spring
----

first, you need to install it:
```bash
cd YOUR_SOURCE_FOLDER
git clone https://github.com/berndhopp/guice.git
cd guice
mvn install
```

then, open bugrap in your IDE, replace

```
'spring' -> 'guice'
'Spring' -> 'Guice'
'import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;' -> import com.google.inject.Inject;''
'@Autowired' -> '@Inject'
'@SpringComponent' -> ''
'import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;' -> ''
```

If you have any classes that you want to be singleton, you need to annotate them with @com.google.inject.Singleton, since
in contrast to spring, guice will default to a 'prototype' strategy ( that is why @SpringComponent can be removed without replacement ).

Your SpringVaadinServlet needs to be adjusted manually, GuiceVaadinServlet expects a @Configuration annotation like this:

```Java
@Configuration(modules = {MyModule.class}, basePackages = "com.mycompany")
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/*", name = "MyServlet", asyncSupported = true)
public static class MyServlet extends GuiceVaadinServlet {
}
```

UI Scope
----

Vaadin guice includes several UI-scoped annotations:

* `@UIScope`: stereotype annotation for guice's UI scope.
* `@GuiceUI`: annotation to be put on UI-subclasses that are to be automatically detected and configured by guice. The annotated UI will be automatically placed in the `@UIScope`.
* `@ViewContainer`: annotation to mark a view container as a UI's default view container for navigation. ViewContainers are used by a UI's `Navigator` A view container must implement one of the following interface:
  - `ComponentContainer`
  - `SingleComponentContainer`
  - `ViewDisplay`
* `@GuiceViewChangeListener`: annotation that adds a `ViewChangeListener` to every `Navigator` created by guice.

Example:

```Java
// MyGuiceUI will be automatically be UI-scoped.
@GuiceUI
public class MyGuiceUI extends UI {
    // ...
    @Inject
    @ViewContainer
    private MyViewContainer myViewContainer;
}
```
